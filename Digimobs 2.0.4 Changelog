It wouldn't be a Digimobs update without a hotfix.

-Fixes to v-pet not returning to your bank if your inventory is full
-Fixes to various client side code trying to trigger on the server side because I'm dumb.
-Added a max level cap to prevent certain crashes that can arise at level 100. This doesn't actually do anything other than preventing you from earning exp at max level.

-Re-added Hagurumon line because I felt like it.
