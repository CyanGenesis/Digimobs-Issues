==General==

To be quite frank, I started this update right before I caught covid and there are a lot of fixes and changes I have made that I have forgotten or went incomplete. Those fixes won't be listed here and the incomplete stuff will be in a

follow up update. Hopefully updates will be more frequent after this one.
