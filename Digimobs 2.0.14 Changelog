ITEMS
-Energy floppies will now no longer put you over your max EG.


ENTITY

-Moar hitbox adjustments
-Moved around the biomes of some night time digimon. There are apparently issues with digimon spawning on sand biomes(Deserts and Badlands) at night time, and this will take a little bit
more studying to figure out why.

-Re-Introducing PVP mode! This works relatively similar to last time. Digimon will not gain exp or be able to recieve item drops in pvp mode, but will return to their v-pet upon death
with 1 hp. To combat some exploiting of this, the v-pets are returned to the bank instead of your inventory upon losing in pvp mode. I DO have plans to expand more pvp stuff in the 
future.

-Fixed an issue where digimon damage was not scaling properly in higher forms. No more 10 minute mega battles! Unless..

-Introducing delay! Attacking in various ways will now add a "delay" before your next attack. The default delay is 8 seconds between attacks, and decreased based on digimon's Speed stat.

-Introducing Special Attacks, the first part! 
-Every digimon now has a signature skill. If you have a digimon from a previous update, please put it in the v-pet and resummon it out to update your digimon with a signature skill.
-All digimon now have the capacity for two extra skills!(Special 1 and Special 2).
-Digimon do not inherently start off with extra skills. By fighting digimon who use the skills in battle, your digimon has a chance to learn them upon defeating the enemy!
*Signatures cannot currently be obtained as extra skills.
*This does not apply to pvp battles
*You CAN tame digimon with initial special skills
*Currently, there are 30 extra skills, 10 for each element, and 3 tiers of each.
-Once you have learned an extra skill, you can equip them through the "Specials" screen on your digimon via the digivice.
*Not all digimon currently have special animations, or projectiles. All newly animated digimon(including the newly animated ones post 2.0.0) will contain special animations.
*Projectiles themselves will be something we work on as we have time as they are cosmetic and other things are more important.

-All special attacks currently scale with the Special Attack stat, and descale with the Special Defense stat.
