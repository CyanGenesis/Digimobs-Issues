GENERAL
The mod is built on Forge 36.1.16.

Decided to try something a little different for a bit and release some mini updates to try and throw some stuff back in the mod. Septemeber is a long ways away for a big update.


ITEMS

-D-Terminal now includes credits for animators in addition to the rest of the credits.
-D-Terminal will also now tell you if digimon have special spawn conditions.


ENTITY
Digimon Re-Added:
-Solarmon/Guardromon(Gold)
Why? Why not?

-Fixed an issue with inventories. This was -technically- a couple of different issues rolled into one. They have been completely re-coded and as a result are much more stable
and should not randomly delete themselves. But this also means that if you had anything in your digimon's inventory prior to this update, it will be deleted.

-Re-added mutations. Digimon can now spawn with certain overlays to appear in a variety of colors. (If you try to nbtedit in a color not currently added, it will crash the game!)

-Adjusted a few spawning conditions causing digimon to appear underground that shouldn't.
-Moved any NIGHT TIME desert spawns to spawn throughout the day. For some reason, digimon do not want to spawn in the deserts at night, and I can't really find any rhyme or reason for it.


-Nerfed EXP because I hate you all.

-Fixed Goddramon's adaptive evolution requirements because it was broke and I refused to admit it.
