Happy 10 year anniversary! Unfortunately time has not permitted me to make this update as large as I had wanted(and has proven yet again I'm better off to sticking with smaller updates),
so I am releasing it in parts over the month of October to give me a little more time to finish other things. All of the old models have finally been ported over for 1.16, so I hope
to fill in the rest of the digimon over the next 4 updates as well.
This update is basically to fix bugs and for some new digimon.

Enter the Royal Knights!
