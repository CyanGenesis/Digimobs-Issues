*Note: This also does not disable ambient mobs such as bats or fish

==Entities==
-Made brown mutations a little browner by request?
-Re-Added Hunger
*Hunger is a little bit different now, as it does not slowly get lowered over time
*Each time your digimon attacks, it has a 25% chance to lose 1 hunger.
*Your digimon will lose half its current hunger upon evolution.
*Upon reaching 0 hunger, your digimon will sit down and not move unless forced to attack
*If your digimon maintains above 75% of its hunger, it will regen 1hp/tick while sitting
*If your digimon is overfed, it may experience a failure evolution(these are temporary for the time being and will not alter your evolution line..for now)
*All vanilla foods edible by the player can be eaten by the digimon. Digimobs related foods will return soon.
