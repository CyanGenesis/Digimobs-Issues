-Added Bits
Bits have a 25% change of dropping from digimon, and scale based on their level
You can check your balance with the /bits balance command. More features will be added to the /bits command in the future, including giving between players.

-NPCs have been added!
This is more of a beta test of sorts for npcs more than anything
NPC vendors selling various items can be found roaming about villages
Because this is a beta, there are a low amount of npcs that spawn(2 per village)
This will change as more npc types and sellable items are added!
*Items that currently do not have prices in the vendor tables cannot be bought or sold from npcs.
*You can ONLY interact with npcs by clicking on them with a digivice
