-Many digimon have recieved sprite updates thanks to Fenix51

-Readded functionality for Degeneration and Mode Changing

-Created a new framework for evolution. This will be used further to expand into various conditional evolutions(failure, dark, death, armor, etc). For the purposes of this update,
temporary digivolution has been implemented. Under certain conditions, certain digimon may evolve into unexpected forms, but only for a limited time. One degenerated, the digimon will
return to its normal line.

-Added an evolution animation. I won't tell you how long this took me to get working and in return you won't break it.

-Certain digimon will now spawn with certain lines based on their biome. For example, Pagumon will typically either spawn with the Devimon line or Sukamon line. 
Now, if pagumon spawns in an ice spikes or snowy mountains biome, it will instead spawn with the icedevimon line exclusively.

-Created a new config file! 
-Make all digimon spawn locations and rarities configurable! Now you can quit harassing me about all of these things!
