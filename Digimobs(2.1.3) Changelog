First and foremost, the minimum Forge requirement has been updated to 36.2.20. 
This version of forge applies a fix for the Log4J security issue that you may
have seen recently in the news, and therefore is perfectly safe for server play

Secondly, Happy New Years. I'm unfortunately quite behind in what I wanted to
have accomplished by now, especially with catching the flu at the beginning of the month.
But part of my resolutions include being more consistent
with my hobbies, including Digimobs. I promise I'll get to npcs soon.

==General==
-New config for exp multiplier. This is pretty self explanitory, and will let you
increase or decrease exp gained from fighting enemies.
-You may also want to refresh your configs

-New command! /digicode
Based off a suggestion to imitate the Runelic mod, /digicode will allow you
to covert text into digicode. There are various commands both for normal use
and for OPed players.


==Entities==

-Introducing Spirals. Spirals come in many different forms, and can spawn as any digimon.
Currently the different colors do not have any differences, but mostly aim to imitate
the various colors in Re:Arise. For digimobs, these serve as "harder" mobs to fight
that will reward you with 50% more exp on kill, and will also drop bytes.
Higher form Spirals will drop higher level bytes.

-All previous Rookie level digimon, aside from a few specific digimon, have been
re-added to the mod. If you have a digimon already with the rookie form in their line,
you should be able to immediately access it for evolution.

-Reintroduced "skins"
These are special textures that can be used on certain digimon.
At the moment only one has been introduced as a reward/request from one of the
modelers(Gaomon(Black))
More to come in the future

-New-
Vorvomon
PawnChessmon(Black)
PawnChessmon(White)
Cutemon

-Remodel-
-Gaomon
-Hawkmon

==Blocks=
-Spawners should now equip spawned digimon with secondary special attacks
like regular spawning
-Spawners should now attach an evolution line to a digimon should you not
specify a rookie form in the wand
-Spawners are no longer limited to spawning on "natural" blocks(dirt,grass,etc)

==Items==
-Re-added bytes, with more tiers
Bytes are now stackable
Bytes have a 25% of dropping from a spiral digimon
Byte tiers:
Byte(25exp)
Mega Byte(50exp)
Giga Byte(75exp)
Tera Byte(150exp)
Peta Byte(500 exp)
Exa Byte(1500 exp)

==Bugs==
-Numerous crashes related to my inability to spell special attacks have been fixed
