==General==
-Added seperate spawning caps for Champion, Ultimate, and Mega level digimon.
This should reduce the number spawning and help out a little on the lag.

==Entities==
-Technically you all get Champion forms beginning with A-C re-added to the mod
Because this update was not planned and I had them already started.

==Blocks=


==Items==
-Bytes now have descriptions, to make their function a little clearer.

==Bugs==
-Various models and textures have had fixes from where they did not port
from 1.12 so well.
